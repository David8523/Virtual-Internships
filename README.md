# Virtual Internships
This repository contains the different tasks and exercises performed in the virtual internships at forage.com.

This website contains virtual internships from a large number of leading multinational companies in different sectors. It is an excellent opportunity to learn a little more about them, their methodology and corporate values.

I will be updating this repository as I complete the different virtual internships.

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. 

### Task 1. Data Quality Assessment

Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis.

Review the data quality to ensure that it is ready for our analysis in phase two. Remember to take note of any assumptions or issues we need to go back to the client on. As well as recommendations going forward to mitigate current data quality concerns.

Draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues. Refer to ‘Data Quality Framework Table’ and resources below for criteria and dimensions which you should consider.

### Task 2. Data Insights

Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation. 

The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is sure that, if correctly analysed, the data would reveal useful customer insights which could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing. Hence, improve performance by focusing on high value customers.

Prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off. Please advise what steps you would take.

### Task 3. Data Insights and Presentation

Using visualisations to present insights.

Visualisations such as interactive dashboards often help us highlight key findings and convey our ideas in a more succinct manner. A list of customers or algorithm won’t cut it with the client, we need to support our results with the use of visualisations. 

Develop a dashboard that we can present to the client at our next meeting. Display your data summary and results of the analysis in a dashboard (see tools/references for assistance).

### Task 1. Data Engineering

Using data engineering to combine full-flight engine data, part manufacturing data, airport location data to create a data lake our analysts can use

You have been asked by GE Aviation leadership to create a single data set that combines all the data listed above into a single table.   

The data you have been given has sheets related to Flight data (so data relating to the health of the mechanical engine of a plane), Location Data for airports, Manufacturing Data (which relate to various airplane parts), and a manufacturing bill of material (which tells you what engines have been used).

In this final form, we can then use this table to either create a prediction of RUL or visualize the data for easy user consumption. This will be done in task two.

### Task 2: Data Visualization

Use data to create a run chart and KPI (key performance indicators) tables based off of simulated Aviation data.

We have supplied a dataset that is ready to be visualized in the resources section below. Your task is to create a run chart using Tableau that will visualize the measurement of a given feature of each operation for a given part number. 

Take screenshots of your workings in Tableau, return to this page and upload your findings
